Pitfall in management info. system :- 
                                        It is a importent at all lavel in all orgnijaction
a MIS is an approch a company uses when making varius busniss process it is a set of process,
to collect importent informaction for making management designes there are some Pitfall can
exist when using a MIS in a company.

          -> Unemployment
          -> Privency and Polocy
          -> Cost of technology upgrades
          -> Lack of job security
          -> Domenante culture
          -> Expensive
          -> Training needs
          -> Too much informaction
          -> Mantinance
          -> In efective


Types of system :-
                   -> Open system
                   -> Close system
                   -> Sub system Super system
                   -> Permanent and Temprary system
                   -> Natural and man made system
                   -> Determenestic and probablic system
                   -> Man made informaction system
                   -> Physical or abstruct system

                OPEN SYSTEM :-- 
                                It receve input from the environment and some time return outputs to the environment,
                                are called Open system, A system is said to be open If it's input varius outputs from,
                                it's environment converts them into goods, services and waste matrials and then export,
                                them into the environment.

                CLOSE SYSTEM :--
                                system that have shield boundrys and nither receve input nor produce outputs are called
                                close system, they are independent of there environment close system are required for,
                                stability and consistency where as open system are required as open uncertain condiction.

                SUB AND SUPER SYSTEM :--
                                        Each system is a part of a large system the buissness ferm is viwed as the system,
                                        of total system when focus is on production , distrebuction of gole and sorce of,
                                        profit and income, The total system consist of all the system , attrebutes and relactinship.
                                        Sub system are the smaller system within a system Super system denotes extremly large and 
                                        complex system.

                PERMANENT AND TEMORARY SYSTEM :--
                                                Permanent system is a time spend that is long relateve to the operaction of human.
                                                Temprary system is one having a sort time spend.

                Natural and man made system :--
                                                system which is made by man is called man made system.
                                                system which are in the environment made by nature are called Natural system.
                
                Determenestic and probablic system :--
                                                       Determenestic system is one in which all even is perfectly pridectible, if we get the,
                                                       descripction of the system state at a perticuler time the next stage can easely predicted,
                                                       probablic system is one in which the accurence of system probablic can not be perfectly predicted.

                Man made informaction system :--
                                                It is genraly beleved that the informaction reduced uncertinety about a state or event,
                                                an informaction system is the basic form of instrection between the user and the analyst,
                                                it detrmienes the nature of the relactinship amount decision  maker's.

                Physical and abstruct system :--
                                                Physical system is tengible enteties that may be static or dynamic in nature.
                                                Abstruct system is non Physical it is logic of Physical sitation.

MAintenence :-
    It ia nessesury to elemenate errors in the working system during it's working life system maintenence is perform for three reasions
    -> To correct errors 
    -> To keep system update 
    -> To imrove the system

    There are 2 types of MAintenence :-
        --> Hardware maintenence :-
            It includes computer maintenence includes computer hardware and it's pereferal as well as network maintenence it can take
            place in 3 forms :-
                ---> Preventive maintenence :-
                    It is regarded and stitch in time that save from damages. It of hardware is a precautionary menager.

                ---> Breakdown maintenence:-
                    It undertaken when a machine Breakdown and stope working because of damage of any working when the machine fails because 
                    of damaged part the part can be got repaired or a new part is instaled.
                    
                ---> Replacement maintenence :-
                    It involves replasing the majer deviseis of hardware like keyboard,printer,mouse and other devices.
        
        --> software maintenence :-
            It is more critical as compare to hardware there are many issues involves in software maintenence it covers a wild range of
            activeties, including corrction of coding and degine errors, updating documaintation and test data and provide user support
            many activeties clasifyed as software maintenence are actually enhencement.
            It has following types :-
                ---> Corrective :-
                    It means repairing or making changes.

                ---> Aductive :-
                    It means changing the programs function.

                ---> Perfactive :-
                    It means enhencing the performence and modefying the program to responde to the user for softeare maintenence
                    softeare re-engneering concept has been devloped.

Decision making in MIS :- 
    decision making is a process that result in the selection of a cource of it is a daily activety for any humanbeen efective and 
    sucessfull design results in profit.
    The following steps are used in design making :-
        -> Identefication of the purpose of the design
        -> Informaction gathreing
        -> Principal for the jugung
        -> Analyse the choices
        -> Evelouction of alternative
        -> Select the best alternative
        -> Execute the design
        -> Evaluates the result
