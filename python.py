HELLO FRIENDS HERE WE ARE GOING TO LEARN PYTHON

FIRST OF ALL I TELL YOU ABOUT DECLEARING DATA TYPES

SO FIRST WE TYPE A CAMMAND (PYTHON)
as you can you can see a task will run and now we start typing a progrem

as in terminal we write a=32 now we press enter and see
our cammand will acepted
now i will type () and get value of (a)
as you can see we will get (a)
now we will type (b) and give a value to it
so 90 is given to (b)
now we will add (a) and (b)
so using a+b we are able to add
now we will do -,/ in our progrem


>>> a=3
>>> a
3
>>> a
3
>>> a
3
>>> b=90
>>> a+b
93
>>> a-b
-87
>>> b-a
87
>>> a*b
270
>>> b*a
270
>>> a/b
0
>>> b/a
30
>>> 'python'
'python'
>>> python

>>> a-b
-87
>>> b-a
87
>>> a*b
270
>>> b*a
