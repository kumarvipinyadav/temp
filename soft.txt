Reliability :-
              Probability of failure-free operation for a specific time period or for a given set of input conditions under a 
              specific environment.
              Masure of relibelety :-
                    -> Time between successive failures,
                    -> Number of failures per test interval of a given length
                    -> Can estimate reliability, failure intensity, number of failures observed in next nintervals.
        
Software avilability :-
        It used to ensure that systems are running and avilable most of the time. High avilability is a high persantage of time,
        that the system is functioning high avilability software is majored by it's performence when a sub system fails,
        it's abilety to resume service in a state all faults that affect avilability hardware,
        software and configration can help engginer creates complex system arcetecture.

Safety :-
        The property of being accident-free for (embedded) software systems.
        Software safety has evolved to be a parallel effort to the development of the software itself. The System Safety engineer,
        is involved in each step of the software development process identifying which functions are critical to the safe functioning,
        of the greater system and tracing those functions down into the software modules which support them. 


Assesment :- 
             The Risk Management Assessment, or RMA, is the first step in developing a comprehensive risk management program.
             The RMA identifies, analyzes, and reports on an organization’s material risk exposures. It provides a multi.
             dimensional view of risk, taking into account organization-wide enterprise risks and specific insurance-related
             exposures. A typical Risk Management Assessment consists of five steps, they are: 


Controle :-
           Proper risk management and internal control help organizations understand the risks they are exposed to, 
           put controls   in place to counter threats, and effectively pursue their objectives. They are therefore an 
           important aspect of an organization’s governance, management, and operations. Professional accountants can and 
           should play a leading role in helping their organizations achieve an integrated, organization-wide approach to 
           risk management and internal control—which ultimately helps create, enhance, and protect stakeholder value.



Risk Management :- 
                A risk is a possible unplaned event, It can be +ve or -ve in project management the sucess of our
                projects dpends on our ability. since risks are the unpridictible part of the project it is importent 
                for us to be able to controle them. 

                It means the systemetic application of management policyes, procegers and prectices to the task of identefying,
                Analysing, evaluating, truting and monitering risk. It is the process of identefying, Analysing and quentifying,
                responding to them with a risk strategy and then controlling them. it must be done through out any project,
                we must do it at the begining of the project, at the end of the project, many times during the project,

                Risk Identefication :-- 
                                        The first stap in risk management is identefying the risk that we will see in our project.
                                        
                                        The following point listed for identefying the risk :

                                          --> Scope
                                          --> Time
                                          --> Cost
                                          --> Resourses
                                          --> Orgnijaction
                                          --> Brain stroming Technique
                                          --> Nominal Group Technique
                                          --> Expert Interview

                Risk Quantification : --
                                        It is the process of evaluating the risk that have been identefyed and devloping the data that will be needed
                                        for making decision it can be done from very early in the project until the very end. The objective of,
                                        quantification is to establish a way of arranging the risk in the order of importese.
                
                Risk Responce :-- 
                                They are the approch we can make to dealing with the risk we have idefier and quantifire, it is really based
                                on risk tollrence. major strategy are avoidence, acceptence , transfer and mitigation.

                Risk controle :--
                                The main objective of risk management is to identify the top few risk item and then focus on them a 
                                project manager can controle the risk with the good policy making.
