Reliability :-
              Probability of failure-free operation for a specific time period or for a given set of input conditions under a 
              specific environment.
              Masure of relibelety :-
                    -> Time between successive failures,
                    -> Number of failures per test interval of a given length
                    -> Can estimate reliability, failure intensity, number of failures observed in next nintervals.
        
Software avilability :-
        It used to ensure that systems are running and avilable most of the time. High avilability is a high persantage of time,
        that the system is functioning high avilability software is majored by it's performence when a sub system fails,
        it's abilety to resume service in a state all faults that affect avilability hardware,
        software and configration can help engginer creates complex system arcetecture.

Safety :-
        The property of being accident-free for (embedded) software systems.
        Software safety has evolved to be a parallel effort to the development of the software itself. The System Safety engineer,
        is involved in each step of the software development process identifying which functions are critical to the safe functioning,
        of the greater system and tracing those functions down into the software modules which support them.
