Introduction :-
    A branch of compuer system with the study and creation of systerm form of inteligent system that learn new concept and task.

Importence of AI :-
    They are the meachens which are degined and programmed in such a manner that they think and act like a human.
    It becomes the importent part of our daily life our life is changed by AI because this technology is used in a wide area of day
    to day servises.
    Thise technology reduse human efforts now in many induresties peoples are using this technology to devlop machines to perform 
    the diffrent activity the introduction of AI bring the idea of error free world. this technology will introduce in all the
    sectore to reduce human efforts and give accurate and faster result.

AI and related field :-
    AI used in enggenring 
        -> Meachanical enggenring
        -> Electrical enggenring
        -> Psychologi
        -> Biology
        -> Robotics
        -> Chemistry
        -> Defence
        -> Civil enggenring
        -> Arrow space
    
Knowledge :-
    The importent role that Knowledge play in building inteligent system is now widely accepted in AI, Knowledge can be defined as
    the body of fact sand principle processed by human kind or the act, fact an state of knowing it have familiarty with language,
    concept, procedures, ideas, abstraction, coustems, facts and assosiation.
    The mening of Knowledge is closely related to the meaning of inteligense,
    In biological organism Knowledge is lightly stored as complex structure of inter-connected nurones,
    In computer Knowledge is also stored as symbolic structure but in the form of collection of magnetic spots and voltege states,
    a comman way too repersent Knowledge external to a computer or a human is in the form of return language for example some facts
    and relation repersented in printed english are
        -> Joe is Tall
        -> Bill hates Ytender

Repersenation of Knowledge in AI :-

                                        Mental images
                                              |
                                              |
                                              |
                                        Written test
                                              |   
                                              |
                                              |
                                        Character strings
                                              |           
                                              |
                                              |
                                        Binary numbers
                                              |
                                              |
                                              |
                                        Magnatic sport

    Knowledge consist of facts, concept and rules it can be repersentid in diffrent forms as mental image, Written test, Character
    strings, Binary numbers and Magnatic spots
    Any choice of repersenation will depend on the type of problem to be solved 
    ex: we wish to write a program to play simple card game using the standerd of 52 playing cards, We can repersent cardes in
    diffrent ways the most importent way is to record(Clubs, dimond, hearts, spads) and face value (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
    Jack, Qeen, King) The qeen of hearts might be repersented as <qeen, hearts>. 
    we could assine codes c6 for the 6 of Clubs numeric values.

FOPL ( First order predicte logic ) :-
    It was devloped by Sientiest as a means for formal reasing here natural language like english are translated into symbolic st-
    -ures maid by pridactes, functions, variables, constant, quantefires and logic connectives. The symboles form the basic build-
    -ing blocks for the Knowledge and their combination into valid structure is maid using the syntex rules of combination for ex-
    -ample :
        "All employe of the AI software compny are programers"
        FOPL -> (∀x) AI-software-co-employe(x)--> programer(x)

            ∀    = 'for all x'
            -->  = 'for emplies' or 'then'

            predicte = AI-software co-employe(x)
            pridactes = programer(x)
    It's very importent for AI for the logical and reasing process pro-positional Dictionary logic is a spcial case of FOPL.

Syntex and Semaentics for prp-positional Dictionary logic :-
    Valid statement of sentence in PL are determined acording to the rules of pro-positional Dictionary syntex this syntex rule the combination
    of basic building block such as pro-positional Dictionary and logic connectives, pro-
    positional Dictionary are elementry atomic sentences some example of symple pro-positional Dictionary are
    -> It's raining.
    -> My car is painted silver.
    -> Snow is white.

    Compount pre-positional Dictionary are formed from atomic formulase using the logical connectives not, and, or,
    The following are compound pro-positional Dictionary example 
    -> It's raining and the wind is blowing.
    -> The moon is made of white colores or it's not.
    -> The sum of 10 and 20 is not 50.

Features of FOPL :- 
    -> More expressive and powerfull repersenation 
    -> Allow us to repersent almost any english sentence    
    -> Genraliation of pro-positional logic

Syntex of Pro-positional Dictionary logic :-
    The syntex of PL is defined as following
    -> P&Q formulase the following are formulase
        --> ~P
        --> P V Q
        --> P ∧ Q
        --> P --> Q
        --> P <--> Q
    All formulase are gentated from a finight number of the above operation an example of a compound formula is
    (P ∧ (Q V R) --> (Q --> S))
    
Semaentics :-
    The Semaentics or meaning of a sentence is just the value true of false (T & F) could not be confuced with the symboles T & F
    which can appier within a sentence .
    Semaentics rules for statement

            +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
            | Rule Number       |   True statement  |   False statement |
            +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
            | 1                 |       T           |       F           |
            | 2                 |      ~F           |      ~T           |
            +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+ 

Property of statement :-
    -> Satifiable
    -> Contradiction
    -> Valid
    -> Equivalence
    -> Logical consequences
    
    -> Some equivalence laws 
        -> Idempotency
            P v P = P   P or P
            P ∧ P = P   P &  P

        -> Associalivity
            (P v Q) v R = P v (Q v R)
            (P ∧ Q) ∧ R = P ∧ (Q ∧ R)

        -> Commutaivity
            (P v Q) = (Q v P)
            (P ∧ Q) = (Q ∧ P)
            P <--> Q = Q <--> P

        -> Distribuivity
            P ∧ (Q v R) = (p ∧ Q)v(P ∧ R)
            P v (Q ∧ R) = (p v Q)∧(P v R)

        -> De-morgans law
            (P v Q) = ~P ∧ ~Q
            (P ∧ Q) = ~P v ~Q

        -> Condition elimination
            P --> Q = ~P v Q

        -> Bi- Conditional elimination
            P <--> Q = (P --> Q)∧(Q --> P)
