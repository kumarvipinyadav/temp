Introduction :-
    CG is the field of visual computing where one utilised computers both to genrate visual image and to integrate or alter visual
    information sampled from the real world.
    This field can be diveded into sevral areas into real time 3D used in vedio games, vedio capture and vedio creation spcial
    effects edditing for movies and telivision, image edditing and modeling devlopment in CG was first devloped by academic
    intrest and government sponsership.

Application Area of CG :-
    -> Computer edit degine application (CAD)
    -> Computer games
    -> Computer annimation 
    -> Geographical information system (GIS)
    -> Education and training
    -> Classroom demostration
    -> Working model of any machienry
    -> visualigation 
    -> Comrcial application

    -> Computer edit degine application (CAD) :-

        It allow for simple degine of building, electronic circuit board, machinal system and engeenring degine in both 2D and 3D.
        It save time and energy for example car manifecturing compney the manager wants to devlop.
        
        CAD can also be of diffrent form possible type can be.

            --> Machinal degine
            --> Arcitectural field
            --> Electronic circuit degine
            --> Arrow dynamic modeling and degine field
    
    -> Computer Games :-

        CG is very usefull for devloping computer games such as PUBG, Pacman, Donkey Kong, Mario.
        The early version of games are 2D grapgics but the latter versions have 3D objects.
        annimation is a standerd component.

    -> Computer Annimation :-
        is the art of creating moving image via the use of computer it is a sub field of CG and annimation it created by 3D computer
        grapgics.

Video Display Device :-
    The operation of most vedio devices based on standerd CRT

                                magnetic coil             \|

    There are 2 type of display 
        -> Raster scan display 
            The most coman type of grapgics moniter is the raster scan display based on TV technology in it the raster scan system
            system the electronic beam is swep acrose the screen one raw at a time from top to bottom.

        -> Randam scan display :
            Here the electronic beam are directed only to the part of the screen where a picture is to be drown.
    
    Colour CRT Display :
        A CRT display Colour picture by using a combination of fosfours that emmit diffrent Colour lite the 2 basic technique for
        producing Colour display with a CRT are the

            -> Beam pantration method
                it for displaying method for displaying Colour picture has been used with Randam scan moniter 2 layers of fosfours
                red and green are coated onto the inside of the CRT screen.

                it used in raster scan system including Colour TV because they produce a varity of Colour then beam pantration

GUI (Grsphical user interface ) :-
    It's an interface that allow user to intrect with diffrent electronic devices using icons and other visual indicaters the GUI 
    were created because CLI were quit complicated and it was diffcult to learn all the commands in it

                                             User

GUI are used in many devices Computr, Mobiles, Smart phones, Mp3 players e.t.c element in GUI 
    -> Windo
    -> Menu
    -> Icons
    -> Controle 
    -> Tabs

    -> Windo
        This is the element that display the information on the screen it is very easy to manipulate a windo it can be opened or
        closed.with the click of an icon it can be moved to any area by dragging it in a multitasking environment multiple windose
        can be open at the same time there are multiple types of windo in a such as contaner windo, browser windo, test terminal
        windo, child window and message windo.

    -> Menu
        A menu contains a list of choises and it allow it user to select 1 from them a menu bar is displayed horigently acrose the
        screen such as pull down menu.
        Another type of menu is the context menue.
    
    -> Icons
        Files, Programs, Web pages can be repersentid using a small picture in a GUI this picture is known as icon.

    -> Controle
        Information is an application can be directly need using the Graphical Controle element.

    -> Tabs
        A tab is associated with a view pin it usially contains a text level or a Graphical icon they are used in varius web 
        browser such as internet explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, edge and Chrome.

    grapgics pattern are drown on a randam scan system by directing the electron beam along the component lines of the picture
    lines are defined by the values for there cordinate and points and thise input cordinate values are converted into x and y

        |m| = 1 if [ Δy = Δx ]

DDA(Digital Difrential Analyser) :-
    It's a scan convertion algorithem is the scan convertion algorithem based on calculating Δy and Δx. which sample the line at 
    unit interwells in one cordinate and determine coresponding integer values nearest the line path suppose a line with +ve slope
    if the slope is < or = to 1 then we sample at unit x interwells Δx = 1 then each sucessive y values as

    Δx = 1
    Yk+1 = Yk + m

    subscript k take starting value from k=1, m can be any real number between 0 and 1 
    for lines with a +ve slope > then 1 

    Δy = 1
    Xk+1 = Xk + 1/m

    equation 1 and 2 based on the that the line are to be processed from left end point to the right end point. If the processes is
    reversed so that the starting end point 

    Δx = -1
    Yk+1 = Yk - m

    Δy = -1
    Xk+1 = Xk - 1/m    

    eq 3 and 4 can also be used to calculate pixal poition along a line with -ve slope the DDA algorithem is faster mathod for pixel
    poition.

Circle Genreting Algorithem :-
    Digram ==========   1
    Circle is a frequently used component in picture and graphs a circle is defined as the st of point that are at a given distence
    r from a center poition (Xc,Yc) 
    In above figure un equal spacing shown in figure to remove un equal spacing using poler cordinate r and θ expressing the circle 
    equation in paramatric poler form 
    Digram =========   2
    x = Xc + rcosθ
    y = Yc + rsinθ
    when a display genrated with this equation using a fixed anguler step size a circle is ploted with equaly spaced point th step
    size choosen for θ depend on the application and the display device 
    Digram =========   3
    The shape of the circle is same in each quadrent
